        <p>Hey! I'm Tibor and I'm a Digital Designer based in Budapest. I collaborate with emerging start-ups, businesses and brands to shape their future. Currently I'm building digital products at LogMeIn.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Hungary, where I also obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Graphic Design department of the Institute of Applied Arts in Sopron. Before graduation, I recieved an internship at Prezi, which completely shifted my focus from print design towards digital.</p>
        <p>I'm living in Budapest for 3 years now, and I'm working as a Product Designer on join.me&reg; at LogMeIn, where I help innovate how people meet via computers through solution-focused design. I love to work with multi-disciplinary groups to create intuitive experiences for people.</p>
        <p>Prior to LogMeIn, I was a co-founder and the Design Director on Jingle, a psychology-based dating app. In the meantime I have worked on a series of projects including brand development, marketing sites, digital products and mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Soon there will be a full website. Until then:</p>
